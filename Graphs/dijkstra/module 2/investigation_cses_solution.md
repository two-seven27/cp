# CSES Problem: Investigation

In this task we are asked to answer various questions about the
minimum-price routes from city 1 to city n. The first of the questions
("what is the minimum price of such a route?") can be answered simply
by Dijkstra's algorithm. The other questions can all be answered
using dynamic programming. Let's only consider the question
"how many minimum-price routes are there?" as all of the three questions
can be solved in a very similar way.

We start by running Dijkstra's algorithm from the city n in a reversed graph.
We store the minimum route prices from each city to n in the `price`
array.

Let's then formulate the problem recursively. We will denote with
`n_min_price(x)` the number of minimum price routes from x to n.
We have two base cases:

- If `x = n`, then `n_min_price(x) = 1` because all the flights
  have positive cost.
- If `x ≠ n` and there are no routes from `x` to `n`, then
  `n_min_price(x) = 0`.

Otherwise we can define the value recursively. Let's consider all flights
from `x` that are part of a minimum-price route from `x` to `n`
and denote the end cities of these flights by `y₁, ..., yₖ` (in other words,
for every `yᵢ` it must hold that `price[x] = price[yᵢ] + p` where
`p` is the price of the flight). Now the number of minimum-price routes from `x`
to `n` starting with the flight corresponding to `yᵢ` is
`n_min_price(yᵢ)`, so the total number of minimum-price routes is:


The recursion is well-defined because for every node `x`, the inequality
`price[x] > price[yᵢ]` holds.

We then apply dynamic programming to the recursion by memoizing the calculated
values of the function.
