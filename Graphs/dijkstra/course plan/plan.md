# 🎓 Dijkstra Variants Mini-Course Plan

## 📍 Overview
Learn how to solve advanced graph problems by mastering variants of Dijkstra's algorithm. Each module builds progressively from the standard Dijkstra to more complex versions encountered in CP and real-world applications.

## 🔹 Course Plan

| 📘 Module | 🧠 Focus | 🛠️ Output |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| 1. Standard Dijkstra | Refresher + Clean code template | Reusable template |
| 2. Path Counting | Count number of shortest paths | Track `ways[]` |
| 3. Min/Max Edges | Track min and max edges in shortest paths | `min_edges[]`, `max_edges[]` |
| 4. Path Recovery | Reconstruct actual path | `parent[]` tracking |
| 5. 0-1 BFS | Optimization for 0/1 weighted edges | `deque` version of Dijkstra |
| 6. Multi-Source Dijkstra | Start from multiple sources | Modify initial queue setup |
| 7. Extra State Dijkstra | Handle fuel, coupons, or constraints | `dist[node][state]` variants |
| 8. Dijkstra on Grid | 2D grid weights | 4-directional/8-directional logic |
| 9. Time-Dependent Dijkstra | Weights depending on arrival time | Realistic models (e.g., trains) |
